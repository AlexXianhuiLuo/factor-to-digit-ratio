This started as a joke to find the "best" number. Now I guess it can be used as a benchmark. This program brute forces finding the number with the highest factor to digit ratio.

This could be optimized by implementing prime factorization, however I'm not interested enough to justify the effort. Maybe this has some mathematical purpose I don't really know. I don't have the computational power to get enough data points to create a reasonable model of anything. It might be interesting to try to put a pattern to it with a model of it, or it's derivative.
